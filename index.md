We know each other from the very beginning of the first computer science semester in Aachen. Throughout, our whole study we attended almost the same courses and supported each other in the examination periods. Besides technical interesst, we often play together a round of Magic the Gathering or watch random movies to kill boredom and broaden our horizon in different directions. Besides the obvious passion for computers and video games, we preferr from time to time to play some old fashioned board games or a round of Dungeons and Dragons.
